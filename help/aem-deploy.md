# Your New [!DNL Adobe Customer Support] Experience is Coming 

**October 21, 2019**

We are working on some key enhancements to the support experience for our Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign customers. These changes, which we plan to roll out in April/May of 2020, will allow your organization to access [!DNL Adobe Customer Support] and provide greater visibility into your service history via a common entry portal. We will continue to provide more information to your organization as we get closer to the roll out.  

To get started, we need your help in confirming who will be the System Administrator on behalf of your organization. 

## ACTION: Confirm Your System Administrator (System Admin) 

Our records have identified you as the primary contact during the original purchasing process for your organization’s Adobe Experience Manager/Adobe Campaign product(s). As a result, you are listed as the designated **System Admin**, the person responsible for managing and submitting support requests for these Adobe products.

As a System Admin, you have access to the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console Support Tab] which allows you to:

* Explore improved case management features 
* Conveniently initiate chat conversations with Adobe Customer Support 
* Grant support user access to the portal 

Please confirm that you accept this role (or provide an alternative point-of-contact) as your organization’s System Admin for Adobe Experience Manager/Adobe Campaign products by completing and submitting the [[!DNL System Admin Confirmation Form]](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?idx=N5M8RY) by November 4, 2019. By completing this form, it will ensure the appropriate credentials are assigned to your organization’s designated System Admin and allow us to provide more details to help your organization be prepared for the coming changes.

An email confirmation will be sent upon receipt of the [[!DNL System Admin Confirmation Form]](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?idx=N5M8RY).

For questions regarding this email, please contact us at customercare@adobe.com.

Kind regards and thank you for your assistance.
