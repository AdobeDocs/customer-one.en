# New Adobe Customer Support Experience

## We are excited to announce the launch of the Adobe Admin Console Support Portal in April /May 2020!  

As previously shared, we are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer Support, starting with Adobe Experience Manager and Campaign products. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using the Adobe Admin Console. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer Support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web and chat through this single portal.

## More information

* You will become part of the new experience on April 27th or May 11th
* Customers will receive 2 emails from Adobe with additional instructions (10 days prior to and on the day of Go-Live) to alert you on which day you will be able to begin submitting tickets
* After May 11th the legacy Adobe Experience Manager and Campaign customer case management systems will be decommissioned and customers will be redirected to this page for additional guidance
* Customer cases that were open at time of Go-Live will be migrated to the new system to facilitate closure

## Customer Actions Requested

1. Review the Admin Console enablement content [Get Started](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/get-started.html) and [User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/managing/user-guide.html)
1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) and validate that you have access
1. If you are a System Administrator, please review and validate the support users within your organization for accuracy (these guide pages will help: [Managing Users](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/users.html) and [Managing your Teams accounts](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/accounts.html))
