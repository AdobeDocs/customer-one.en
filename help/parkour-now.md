# New Adobe Customer Support Experience

We care about our customers and are working to make it easier to get help from Adobe Customer Support when our customers need assistance. Adobe is enhancing the way you receive customer support for Adobe Analytics, Target, and Audience Manager by streamlining the experience through a single entry support portal, the Adobe Admin Console. This transition will enable greater visibility into your service history and will allow you to request support via phone, Web, and chat all through a common platform. These changes are planned to take place in April 2022.

We will continue to provide more information to your organization as we get closer to the rollout.

## More information

Throughout February and March 2022, Adobe will be setting up both the new Support System Administrators and the Customer Support Administrators in this portal. 

* If our records indicate that you currently act as a Support System Administrator in the Adobe Admin Console – or – your name was listed on the purchase contract as the Adobe customer contact within your organization, you will be set up as the **Support System Administrator** for your organization.
* If our records indicate that you have requested Adobe customer support in the past - you will be set up as a **Customer Support Administrator**.

Support System Administrators and Customer Support Administrators will see system generated emails as support users are created in Admin Console. Both of these user roles will be able to: 

* Take advantage of case management tools that make it easier to work through support cases with Adobe Customer Support
* Conveniently initiate chat conversations with Adobe Customer Support for Adobe Analytics
* Have greater visibility into your service history 
* Browse popular Help Topics and forums.

In addition, Support System Administrators will be able to:

* Create/remove support users in the portal and govern access roles 
* Review and validate the support users within your organization for accuracy. (For instructions refer to: [Managing Users](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/users.html) and [Managing your Teams accounts](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/accounts.html).)
