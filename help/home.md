# New Adobe Customer Support Experience

We care about our customers and are working to make it easier to get help from Adobe Customer Support when our customers need assistance – starting with Adobe Experience Manager and Campaign products. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a modern entry portal, the Adobe Admin Console Support Portal. We plan to roll out these changes in May 2020.  Once live, your organization will be able to access Adobe Customer Support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common entry portal; and request help via phone, web and chat through a single portal.

We will continue to provide more information to your organization as we get closer to the rollout.  

## More information

In February and March, Adobe will be setting up both the new Support System Administrators and Support Users in this portal.  If our records indicate that you currently act as a Support System Administrator in Adobe’s Admin Console – or – your name was listed on the purchase contract as Adobe’s customer contact for deploying Adobe Campaign and/or Adobe Experience Manager within your organization, you will be set up as the Support System Administrator for your organization.

Support System Administrators will act as super users in the Admin Console and will see system generated emails whenever a new support user is created.  In addition, they will be able to:

*	Create/remove support users in the portal and govern access roles
*	Take advantage of case management tools that make it easier to work through support cases with Adobe Customer Support
*	Conveniently initiate chat conversations with Adobe Customer Support
