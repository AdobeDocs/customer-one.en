# Adobe Customer Support Experience

## Admin Console Support Tickets

Support Tickets are now able to be submitted via the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). For instructions on how to submit a support ticket, review the section for [submitting a support ticket](#submit-ticket).

We are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer Support. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using the Adobe Admin Console. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer Support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web, and chat through a single portal.

## Need Help with the new Support Platform?
 
We are offering a series of online meetings in which customers may bring their questions about the new support process. Select one or more to join:

## How to submit an Admin Console support ticket {#submit-ticket}

In order to submit a support ticket in [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/), you need to have the Support admin role assigned by a System Administrator. Only a System Administrator in your organization can assign this role. Product, Product Profile, and other administrative roles cannot assign the Support admin role and are unable to view the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option used to submit a support ticket. For more information, visit the [enterprise and teams customer care](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/support-and-expert-services.html) documentation.

### Assign the Support admin role

The support admin role is a non-administrative role that has access to support-related information. Support admins can view, create, and manage issue reports.

To assign the Support admin role, follow the [edit enterprise admin role](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html#add-admin-teams) instructions in the administrative roles documentation. Note that only a system administrator for your organization can assign this role. For more information on administrative hierarchy, visit the [administrative roles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/admin-roles.ug.html) documentation.

### Create a support ticket with Admin Console

To create a ticket using [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/), select the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab located in the top navigation. The [!UICONTROL Support Summary] page appears. Next, select the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option.

>[!TIP]
>
> If you are unable to see the **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** option or the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab, you need to contact a System Administrator to assign the Support admin role.

![Select issue](./assets/select-case-type.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Create Case]** dialog appears. You are asked to provide some information such as the product, priority, description, and attach any screenshots to help describe the issue. Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to continue.

The next page allows you to fill in contact information and provide the best time for Adobe Customer Support to contact you. Once complete, select **[!UICONTROL Submit]** in the bottom-right and your ticket is sent to Adobe Customer Support.

### Existing Tickets/Cases

* Between May 11th and May 20th the legacy systems will remain available to work existing tickets/cases to completion.
* Beginning May 20th the support team will migrate remaining open cases from the legacy systems to the new support experience.  You will receive an email notification regarding how to contact support to continue to work these cases.
