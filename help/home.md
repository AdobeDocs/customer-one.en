# New Adobe Customer Support Experience

## Admin Console Support Tickets

We are excited to announce the Adobe Customer Support Experience is live as of May 11th 2020!  

Support Tickets are now able to be submitted via the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)

As previously shared, we are working to improve how you interact with Adobe Customer Support, starting with Adobe Experience Manager and Campaign products. Our vision is to streamline the support experience by moving to a single entry point, using the Adobe Admin Console. Once live, your organization will be able to easily access Adobe Customer Support; have greater visibility into your service history via a common system across products; and request help via phone, web and chat through this single portal.

Review the Admin Console enablement content [Get Started](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/get-started.html), [User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/managing/user-guide.html) and learn how to [create and manage support cases](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/support-and-expert-services.html)
