# Adobe Experience Manager - New Support Experience Coming

**October 21, 2019**

We are working on some key enhancements to the support experience for our Adobe Experience Manager customers. These changes, *which we plan to roll out in April/May of 2020*, will allow your organization to access Adobe Customer Support and provide greater visibility into your service history via a common entry portal.  

We will continue to provide more information to your organization as we get closer to the roll out.  

To get started, we need your help in confirming who will be the System Administrator on behalf of your organization. 

## ACTION: Confirm Your System Administrator (System Admin) 

Our records indicate that you are a designated System Admin within your organization, the person responsible for managing and submitting support requests for these Adobe products.  

As a System Admin, you have access to the Adobe Admin Console Support Tab which allows you to: 

* Explore improved case management features 
* Conveniently initiate chat conversations with Adobe Customer Care 
* Grant support user access to the portal 

>[!NOTE]
>Please confirm that you accept this role (or provide an alternative point-of-contact) as your organization’s System Admin for Adobe Experience Manager/Adobe Campaign products by completing and submitting the System Admin Confirmation Form by November 4, 2019.  
>By completing this form, it will ensure the appropriate credentials are assigned to your organization’s designated System Admin.  

After submitting the System Admin Confirmation Form, no additional actions will be required by you at this time.  We will contact the Systems admins regarding the next steps in early 2020.   

For questions regarding this email, please contact us at mailto:customercare@adobe.com. 

Kind regards and thank you for your assistance.
