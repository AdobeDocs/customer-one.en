# Administrative Roles

Using the Adobe Admin Console, organizations can define a flexible administrative hierarchy that enables fine-grained management of Adobe product access and usage. One or more System admins, provisioned during the enterprise onboarding process, sit at the top of the hierarchy. These System admins can delegate responsibilities to other admins, while still retaining overall control.

Administrative Roles provide the following key benefits to enterprises:

* Controlled decentralization of administrative responsibilities
* Quick view of product assignments—by user and by product
* Functionality to assign quotas to Product admins

## Administrative hierarchy

Applies to: Adobe enterprise customers.

The administrative hierarchy can be used to suit the unique requirements of your enterprise. For example, an enterprise can appoint different admins to manage entitlements to Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings. Alternatively, an enterprise can have different admins to manage entitlements of users belonging to different business units.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The administrative hierarchy doesn't apply to teams customers. Teams customers have a single **System admin** role. The contract owner (_previously referred to as **Primary admin**_) is the system administrator with access to the contract details and the billing history. If you are the current contract owner, you can nominate an existing system administrator (_previously referred to as **secondary admin**_) as the contract owner.

## Add an enterprise admin

Applies to: Adobe enterprise customers.

As an admin, you can assign an admin role to other users, giving them the same privileges as you have, or privileges for a role under your admin role in the hierarchy as described [above](#administrative-hierarchy). For example, as a Product admin you can give Product admin privileges or Product Profile admin privileges to a user, but not Deployment admin privileges. For the permissions on the Admin Console, see the [Permissions matrix](#enterprise-admins-permissions-matrix).

To add or invite an admin:

1. In the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/), choose **Users** > **Administrators**.
 
   Alternatively, go to the relevant Product, Product Profile, or User Group and navigate to the **Admins** tab.

1. Click **Add Admin**.
1. Enter a name or email address. You can search for existing users or add a new user by specifying a valid email address, and filling the information on the screen.
1. Click **Next**. A list of admin roles appears.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* The options on this screen depend on your account and admin role. You can either give the same privileges as you have, or privileges for a role under yours in the hierarchy.
>* As the System Admin of a team, you can assign only one admin role: System Admin.

1. Select one or more admin roles.
1. For Admin types like Product Administrator, Product Profile Administrator, and User Group Administrator, select the specific products, profiles, and groups respectively.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For a Product Profile Administrator, you can include profiles for more than one product.

1. Review the admin roles assign to the user and click **Save**.

The user receives an email invitation regarding the new administrative privileges from `message@adobe.com`.

Users must click **Get started** in the email to join the organization. If new admins do not use the **Get started** link in the email invitation, they would not be able to sign into the Admin Console. 

As part of the sign-in process, users may be asked to set up an Adobe profile if they do not have one already. If users have multiple profiles associated with their email address, users must choose "Join Team" (if prompted) and then select the profile associated with the new organization.
